The Boolean Retrieval Model was the first IR model to be widely used. We make queries with binary numbers and logical operators in this method. A document collection is a set of documents in the Boolean Model for Information Retrieval, and an index term is the subset of documents indexed by the term itself. An index can alternatively be thought of as a property that indicates whether a specific term is in the document. A query's interpretation is set-theoretical. In practise, a query is a Boolean expression with the standard intersection, union, and complement set operators and index terms as operands.
