The most common and basic measurements of information retrieval effectiveness are precision and recall. The fraction of recovered documents that are relevant is known as precision. The percentage of relevant papers that are retrieved is known as recall. Documents that assist the user in addressing his question are considered relevant. Non-Relevant items are those that do not supply information that is genuinely beneficial. These two measures can be defined using the same vocabulary as a confusion matrix. The accuracy and recall metrics focus the evaluation on the return of true positives, asking how many of the relevant documents were located and how many false positives were returned.
