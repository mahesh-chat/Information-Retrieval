A mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to their places in a document or series of documents is stored in an inverted index data structure. It's a hashmap-like data structure that guides you from a word to a text or a web page. Inverted indexes are typically used to process queries quickly and concurrently. Each term in every indexed document is given its own inverted list, which contains the information needed to process that term when it appears in a query. Each term in an inverted index has its own inverted list.
