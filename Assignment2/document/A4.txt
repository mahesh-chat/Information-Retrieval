The distinction between posting lists in a non-positional index and posting lists in a positional index is that each posting in the former is simply a unique docID, whereas each posting in the latter is both a unique docID and a list of positions. We can answer phrase queries using positional posting, and proximity queries using non-positional posting. You need to still access the inverted index entries for each individual term to process a phrase query. As previously, you'd start with the least common term and work your way down the list of potential options. The same general technique is utilised in the merging process as before, but instead of merely confirming that both terms are in a document, you must also ensure that their places in the document are compatible with the phrase query being assessed. This necessitates the calculation of offsets between the words.
