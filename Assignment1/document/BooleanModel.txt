The Boolean Retrieval Model is the first adopted IR model. In this method, we make queries using binary numbers and logical operators. In the Boolean Model for Information Retrieval, a document collection is a set of documents and an index term is the subset of documents indexed by the term itself. An index can also be seen as an attribute that says whether a particular term exists in that document. The interpretation of a query is set-theoretical. In practice, a query is a Boolean expression where the set operators are the usual intersection, union, and complement, and the operands are index terms.
