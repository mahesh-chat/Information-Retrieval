A non-positional index's posting list differs from a positional index's posting list in that each posting in the former is merely a unique docID, whereas each posting in the latter is both a unique docID and a list of positions. We may use positional posting to answer phrase queries and non-positional posting to answer proximity questions. To perform a phrase query, you must still access the inverted index entries for each individual term. As before, begin with the least frequent phrase and work your way down the list of possible alternatives. Instead of just checking that both words are in a dot, the merging procedure use the same basic method as previously.
