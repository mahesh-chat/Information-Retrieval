An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. In simple words, it is a hashmap like data structure that directs you from a word to a document or a web page. Inverted Indexes are primarily used to allow fast, concurrent query processing. Each term found in any indexed document receives an independent inverted list, which stores the information necessary to process that term when it occurs in a query. In an inverted index, each term has an associated inverted list.
