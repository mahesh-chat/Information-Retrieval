Precision and recall are the most frequent and basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness. Precision is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant. Recall is the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved. Relevant items are those documents that help the user in answering his question. Non-Relevant items are items that donâ€™t provide actually useful information. We can use the same terminology used in a confusion matrix to define these two measures. The measures of precision and recall concentrate the evaluation on the return of true positives, asking what percentage of the relevant documents have been found and how many false positives have also been returned.
